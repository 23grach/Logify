# Keep your design system consistent — and versioned.

This plugin helps you track changes to local styles and components in your Figma file. Whether you’re updating colors, tweaking typography, or refactoring components, it captures the differences between versions and presents them in a clean, structured changelog — directly on the canvas.

No need to manually note what was changed or when. Just run the plugin, and it will detect added, modified, or removed design tokens and UI elements. You can then insert a formatted changelog as a Figma frame, perfect for documentation, handoff, or version control.

- Compare current and previous states automatically
- Generate a visual changelog block inside your file
- Group changes by Added / Changed / Removed
- Keep your system transparent and maintainable

Simple. Reliable. Fully local. No external syncs required.
